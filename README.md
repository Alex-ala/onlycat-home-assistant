# OnlyCat Integration for Home Assistant

HomeAssistant integration for [OnlyCat](https://www.onlycat.com/) flaps.

## Features

* 🏠 Know whether your pet is home or on the hunt using the Device Tracker
  * 🐾 In case your pet chooses another exit, you can override the presence using the set_pet_location service
* 🚪 Manage the active door policy manually or using automations
* 🔎 Keep track of your device and build automations with it using sensors for:
   * 📶 Flap connection status
   * 🕒 Flap events (timestamp, RFID codes, trigger source, event classification)
   * 🐭 Contraband detection
   * 🔐 Lock state
* 🔄 Control your flap remotely using reboot and remote unlock options

Common automation ideas enabled by this integration include:

* 🚨 Switch the door policy to "Locked" for a longer time period than usual when contraband is detected
* 💦 Deter intruders by triggering a sprinkler when an unknown RFID code is detected
* 🧹 Start your robot vacuum when your pet leaves the house
* 😻 Roll out the red carpet for your pet by activating welcome lights or triggering a feeder upon arrival
